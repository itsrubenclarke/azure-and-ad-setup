<h1>Project: Deploying an Active Directory Lab in Azure</h1>


<p> 
This project Is the first amongst a collection focused on implementing Azure and Active Directory.
The goal here is to create a basic lab that mirrors a real working environment, providing me with hands-on-learning and practical experience with Active Directory services in a Cloud-based environment.
</p>


<h2>Overview </h2>

<p>In this project, I will set up and establish a connection between two virtual machines, each assigned a specific role. One virtual machine will function as the Domain Controller, while the other will be configured as the Client. This will allow me to perform a basic network traffic inspection.</p>

<h2>Key Objectives</h2>
<h3>Virtual Machine Setup</h3>

-  Configure and deploy the Domain Controller 
-  Configure and deploy a Client 

<p>
  <h3>Remote Connectivity</h3>
  
  -  Establish Remote Desktop Connection (RDP) between the Virtual Machines (VMs)
</p>

<p>
  <h3>Network Traffic Analysis</h3>
  
  -  Perform a basic network traffic inspection between the Domain Controller and Client Virtual Machines
</p>
<p>
  <h3>Operating Systems Used</h3>
